Android: Select location on map using draggable markers and Google Search API
When developing a map focused app in Android, sometimes you will want your users to select accurate location. Mostly you will use Google Search API, which is robust really. However if you take a closer look at Google map markers, you will realise that they can be dragged to a precise location. 
First get Google maps api key from their website by following instructions from their page. After getting the key and enabling billing, you have to enable maps api with any additional APIs you might need like Places API.
